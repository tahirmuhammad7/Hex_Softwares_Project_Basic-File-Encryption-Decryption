# Hex_Softwares_Project_Basic-File-Encryption-Decryption
This project is a simple file encryption and decryption program built in C++ using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It encrypts and decrypts text files by shifting characters with a fixed key and demonstrates basic cryptography, file handling using fstream, and object-oriented programming concepts. Developed as a learning task by Hex Softwares.
